# subnetcalc #
A very simple subnet calculator written in C. It's nothing fancy at all,
just a small project of mine to get going with C.

Simply build it (make), run it (./subnetcalc) and enter the subnet 
mask in slash notation but without the slash. 
For example enter 24 for a 24-bit subnet mask and the
program will output the total number of addresses in the range aswell
as the total number of usable address for hosts.
